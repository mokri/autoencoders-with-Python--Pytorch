# autoencoders-with-Python--Pytorch
 reduced the "resolution" of the image using autoencoders for prediction, using pytorch.

This code is a part of another project under develpopment.
the goal of this autoencoder is to encode images, and use them to generate new images given some input data using GAN's.
